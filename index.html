			<li><strong>Summary:</strong>
				I don't know why, but for many years I used to think that programming is too complicated for me. This year I realized that at least I have to try. 
				Anyway, I am a quite persistent and intelligent person, so why not?) Now I study every day and I'm really going to become a skilled specialist. 
				Thank EPAM for this good oportunity.</li>
